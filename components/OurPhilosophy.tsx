        Our aim is to educate, empower and reduce stress in context – that might
        be with family, school or work. It is our philosophy that this is not
        done by fixing or treating the autistic person but supporting the person
        to understand themselves as fully as possible and providing information
        so that the context supports everyone to function to their fullest
        potential.

            As a psychotherapist who has spent over fifty thousand hours working
            1:1 with autistic people I understand that neurodevelopmental
            disorders have a profound impact on the autistic person and their
            family. Autism is not something that we view here as a superpower or
            a problem to be treated or fixed. We view autism pragmatically.
            There are areas that an autistic person will have strengths and
            other areas of life and relationships that will be challenging. We
            are the first practice that incorporates education and workplace
            assessment into our core report, recommendations and plan.

          <p class="text-left mt-2">
            Each autistic person is completely individual. It is important that
            there is a multi-disciplinary perspective offered throughout the
            assessment, reporting and support process. We collaborate and debate
            following our meeting in order to offer a thorough assessment and
            reporting process. Every person at the autism shed has worked with
            autism for many years and the majority of us have lived experience
            of autism in one way or another. We strive to know you as fully as
            possible and do not presume that our experience will be the same as
            yours.

            Accurately diagnosing autism can be complex, which is why it is
            important to use tried and tested tools used by professionals who
            have a depth of knowledge in autism.

            The Autism Diagnostic interview – Revised (ADI-R) is a systematic,
            organised, and structured interview used for the diagnosis of
            children, teenagers and adults with an autistic spectrum disorder.
            In assessing with ASD, ADI-R together with ADOS-2 is used as the
            Gold Standard.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left mt-2">
            The Autism Diagnosic Observation Schedule (ADOSII) is a
            semi-structured, standardised assessment of communication, social
            interaction and play. This tool can be used in the assessment and
            formulation process for toddlers to adults with varying degrees of
            language skill. These tools supplement the multidisciplinary
            evaluation approach along with evidence from family, school and work
            setting settings.

        Autistic people should be assessed according to (DSM-V, British

        research to ensure that our knowledge is at the cutting edge of autism
        research.
