            Here at the autism shed we do not believe that autism is something
            to be treated but sadly when it is not understood and the autistic
            persons context is not suitable autism can become traumatic. We have
            expertise in this area and we are here to help â€“ either with 1:1
            psychotherapy or training and education for your family, school or
            workplace.
