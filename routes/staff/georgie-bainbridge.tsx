            I am a chartered practitioner psychologist and registered,
            accredited psychotherapist. I have thousands of hours of clinical
            experience working with autistic people both in inpatient settings
            with the NHS and in private practice. My clinical experience is
            important and informative in the process of assessment.

            I have been in private practice since 2013 having managed Promis
            addictions clinic for five years prior to setting up on my own.

            It has been a joy to find a team of dedicated professionals to work
            with over the last few years and to now be working as part of a
            multidisciplinary team here at the shed. We all have lived
            experience of autism in one way or another, which makes us dedicated
            and passionate about what we do.

            I have a particular interest in sensory integration, autism and the
            similarities/crossovers with trauma. I’m also curious about
            neurodiversity and class in psychotherapy and training. I am a
            research and academic lecturer at the Metanoia Institute. I also
            supervise doctoral research candidates.
